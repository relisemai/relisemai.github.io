**Updates abound!** I have been sadly remiss in updating this website, but I am making an attempt to bring it up to speed now. The last year was very eventful, and I'm honored to provide every update below.

**Publication updates:** I have had two new papers published. 
1. My submission ["Modeling human-autonomy team steering behavior in shared-autonomy driving scenarios"] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2025.07.003) was accepted and published at the 12th IFAC Symposium on Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles in lovely Tempe, AZ, USA!.
2. I presented and published ["Performance measures and sim-to-real gap assessment of human-autonomy teaming in obstacle avoidance"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3726301.3731540) at the 2025 SigSim PADS Doctoral Colloquium in Santa Fe, NM, USA.

**Presentations:** I have had numerous additional presentations, which I will sadly not be able to list here for brevity. Please see my talks page for details!

And last, but certainly not least, I am thrilled to say my [Link Foundation Modeling, Simulation, and Training Fellowship](https://linksim.org/) was renewed for 2025-26.
