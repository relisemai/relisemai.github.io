**Talks update:** I am honored to announce that I have been selected to present at the 2024 Modeling, Estimation, and Controls Conference panel "The Future of the Controls Field: Research Perspectives From Young Members of the MECC Community."

I will discuss symbiotic autonomous team modeling and evaluation from a dynamical systems perspective--that is, when humans work with an autonomous teammate, how do they interact? How does human interaction with autonomous teammates differ from human interaction with other humans? How does the joint team perform, and can we influence joint team performance? The answers to these questions are pivotal to future symbiotic autonomy systems.
