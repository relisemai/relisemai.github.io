TA for Mechatronics under Professor Sandipan Mishra. Mechatronics is a senior-level elective course that combines the sheer mathematical fun of control theory, the joy of characterizing and using hardware, and the headaches of hardware-software integration into a high-workload course that challenges even the few graduate students who take it. It is, without a doubt, my favorite course to TA.
