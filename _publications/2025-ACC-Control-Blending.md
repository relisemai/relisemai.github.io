title: "Modeling human-autonomy team steering behavior in shared-autonomy driving scenarios"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-ACC-Control-Blending
excerpt: 'Well-accepted models such as the two-point steering model and its variations describe human steering behavior in non-autonomous vehicles. However, these models may not describe human steering in a shared autonomous vehicle, where the human driver cooperates with an autonomous controller. This work explores how the generalized two-point steering model, a variation of the classical two-point model, may apply to human steering in a shared autonomous vehicle. This study reports two key findings: (1) We find that humans do not necessarily steer the vehicle to the exact lane center, perhaps due to imprecise distance perception or a preference to stay off-center in the lane. Thus, we propose adding a steering bias term to the generalized steering model to account for this behavior; (2) We also find that human steering adapts so that the overall team steering--the combined human and autonomous steering input--behaves according to the generalized steering model with this new bias term. We collected data over 150 runs across 5 drivers and 3 levels of autonomy, and found that the modified generalized steering model accurately predicts team steering behavior, with a minimum coefficient of determination of 0.85 and an average root mean squared error ranging from 1.7-5.9x10^-4 across all drivers.'

Well-accepted models such as the two-point steering model and its variations describe human steering behavior in non-autonomous vehicles. However, these models may not describe human steering in a shared autonomous vehicle, where the human driver cooperates with an autonomous controller. This work explores how the generalized two-point steering model, a variation of the classical two-point model, may apply to human steering in a shared autonomous vehicle. This study reports two key findings: (1) We find that humans do not necessarily steer the vehicle to the exact lane center, perhaps due to imprecise distance perception or a preference to stay off-center in the lane. Thus, we propose adding a steering bias term to the generalized steering model to account for this behavior; (2) We also find that human steering adapts so that the overall team steering--the combined human and autonomous steering input--behaves according to the generalized steering model with this new bias term.
