excerpt: 'This paper presents a human-as-advisor architecture for shared human-machine autonomy in dynamic systems. In the human-as-advisor architecture, the human provides suggested control actions to the autonomous system; the system uses a model of the human controller to ascertain the systemâ€™s state as perceived by the human. The system combines this information with additional sensor measurements, yielding an improved state estimate. We apply this architecture to the problem of lane-centering an autonomous vehicle in the presence of conflicting lane markings that render the true lane center uncertain. '
