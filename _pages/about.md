This is Rene Mai's research and academic profile page.

Research Interests
======
Fundamentally, the question that drives my research is how humans can build our technology and devices so that we achieve peak performance together. I try to integrate engineering and cognitive science perspectives in my approach to symbiotic human-machine autonomy (also called shared autonomy). My focus is modeling human-autonomy interaction in complex systems such as robotics and transportation as a dynamical system, rather than from a social or data-driven perspective.

Professional Profile
======
I am a mechanical engineering PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. I am also a Pathways intern at NASA's Ames Research Center, where I work on the Digital Information Platform and the Human-Autonomy Teaming lab. For DIP, I work on algorithms and methods for fine-tuning large-language models for aviation. In the HAT lab, I am working on human modeling for future urban air mobility applications.

Before RPI, I worked as a patent litigation attorney at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP. Through my work at both firms, I discovered my true love of learning and controls engineering, which led me to leave my legal career and start my PhD. 

My undergraduate degree is in physics from Texas A&M University, and my juris doctor is from the University of Texas at Austin School of Law.
