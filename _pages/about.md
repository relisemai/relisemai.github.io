This is Rene Mai's research and academic profile page.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in symbiotic human-machine autonomy (also called shared autonomy).  

Professional Profile
======
I am a mechanical engineering PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. I am also a Pathways intern at NASA's Ames Research Center, where I work on the Digital Information Platform and the Human-Autonomy Teaming lab. For DIP, I work on algorithms and methods for fine-tuning large-language models for aviation. In the HAT lab, I am working on human modeling for future urban air mobility applications.

Before RPI, I worked as a patent litigation attorney at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP; at both firms, I discovered my true love of learning and controls engineering. 

My undergraduate degree is in physics, from Texas A&M University, and I got my juris doctor from the University of Texas at Austin School of Law.
