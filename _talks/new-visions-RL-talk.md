Lecture covers basic reinforcement learning concepts, starting from the basics of state, action, policy, and reward, then introducing the Bellman equation. Students are introduced to the differences between value iteration and Q learning and the relative advantages of each, along with simple discussion of how the problems for each method are tackled. Students simulate a reinforcement learning task in a physical, interactive exercise.
