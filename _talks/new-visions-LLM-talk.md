Students are guided through pre-discussion learning via worksheets. Discussion is socratic style, to introduce students to common forms of discussion classes and prompt them to deeply consider the questions LLMs require developers and users to answer for responsible development, deployment, and use. Examples of LLM hallucination are used to illustrate the importance of correct prompt choices and critical reading. Students learn the nuances of academic ethics when using LLMs. Lesson concludes with an exercise in autoregression that puts the students in the place of an LLM responding to a prompt.
